Due to JavaScript&rsquo;s evented nature, most I\/O is performed asynchronously. Especially when our Node.js process is a networked application. If we can measure asynchronous activity in a decoupled way, we can find out where an application is waiting. <br \/><br \/>This means we can diagnose I\/O problems in external infrastructure! This workshop introduced an innovative visualization tool that diagnoses various infrastructural and architectural issues.<br \/> <br \/>Attendees will learn the following:<br \/> <br \/>* How to identify and reduce latency in your servers<br \/>* Finding and fixing significant asynchronous bottlenecks<br \/>* Using Node.js to identify problems in your server architecture<br \/>* How to debug asynchronous behavior<br \/>* When (and how) to use development profiling vs APM-based production profiling","speakers":[{"username":"david.clements","id":"3280075","name":"David Mark Clements","company":"nearForm"},{"username":"mathias_buus.70qmo92","id":"5624265","name":"Mathias Buus","company":"Beaker Browser"}],"seats":"0","company":"Intermediate","time_compiled":"1539214800|1539219000|October|10|2018|Wednesday|2018-10-10 16:40|4:40pm|5:50pm"},{"id":"24214c7e6d78b3a53f841b448eb8e7ac","event_key":"38","event_type_sort":"3","event_type":"Application Development and APIs","name":"Fail Faster: Adding Circuit Breakers to your APIs - Craig Freeman, Kenzan","venue":"West Ballroom B","description":"Node.js is known for it&rsquo;s ability to provide fast responses, which makes it a perfect candidate for an orchestration layer. API failures happen to the best of us and the trick is to be prepared for them. Circuit breakers are a way to prevent upstream dependency issues from cascading down to your other microservices by providing a mechanism for fast fault detection. When this happens, the circuit breakers will trip, causing subsequent requests to the dependencies to respond with a failure status code before another request can be made. This allows you to handle your failed requests quicker, which results in a better overall user experience until the breaker can reset. This talk covers the relationship of circuit breakers to a typical microservices ecosystem as well as demonstrates the pros and cons of this approach.","speakers":[{"username":"craig_freeman.1y7earbe","id":"5624295","name":"Craig Freeman","company":"Kenzan"}],"seats":"0","company":"Intermediate","time_compiled":"1539217200|1539219000|October|10|2018|Wednesday|2018-10-10 17:20|5:20pm|5:50pm"},{"id":"a18c6e8077cb0a6160eccae769752a5a","event_key":"58","event_type_sort":"18","event_type":"Testing Tools and Infrastructure","name":"npm and the Future of JavaScript - Laurie Voss, npm, Inc.","venue":"West Ballroom C","description":"npm has more than 10 million users, and they download 7 billion packages a week.

While the core is written in C++ with the JUCE framework, we've started using JavaScript and Node to build extensions like file browsing, package management and search. Our latest work with Node is a user-facing package called Node for Max, which allows our users to write custom Node applications that run in parallel with the main Max application. With this tool, users could monitor a Max installation remotely, or design a generative music algorithm in JavaScript, or build a network of Max patches that communicate with each other. We're excited to talk about our technical approach and some of the creative possibilities that we envision.","speakers":[{"username":"starakajian","id":"5950630","name":"Sam Tarakajian","company":"Cycling '74"}],"seats":"0","time_compiled":"1539301200|1539301500|October|11|2018|Thursday|2018-10-11 16:40|4:40pm|4:45pm"},{"id":"d4205ddbaf82c37261317a9301ae2d26","event_key":"82","event_type_sort":"10","event_type":"Keynote","name":"Keynote: JavaScript: Enterprise Adoption and Usage - Garth Hansen, Software Engineer, The Walt Disney Company","venue":"West Ballroom C","description":"Despite being over two decades old, not until recent years has JavaScript really been acknowledged as a first-class citizen within corporate enterprise software.
